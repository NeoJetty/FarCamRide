# FarCamRide

While recording scenic ride videos in Elden Ring, I encountered several issues:

- **Constant Zoom Level**: The zoom level remains fixed.
- **Grass Rendering**: Grass appears too small and cardboard-like, and it disappears too early (pop-in).
- **Building LoD**: Level of Detail (LoD) for buildings decreases too soon at zoomed-out views.
- **FPS Drops**: Frame rate drops during recording.
- **Camera Collision**: Camera collisions with the environment are too harsh for a relaxed video.
- **Camera Zoom Behavior**: Camera zooms in abruptly while sprinting and jumping.
- **Camera Turn Speed**: Difficulty maintaining a constant camera turn speed.
- **Direction Change**: Turning the camera can irregularly alter the movement direction.

This script emulates controller inputs to achieve smooth riding while the camera turns at a constant speed.
